# 🚀 C Programming Practice & Algorithms

Welcome to my C programming repository! 

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm Kerem. I'm a first-year Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for software development. My long-term vision is to build a career as an AI/Data Scientist, and I am currently establishing a rock-solid foundation in algorithms and logic using C.

## 📁 About This Repository
This repository serves as my personal code archive and learning diary. Rather than one massive project, it contains a collection of standalone `.c` files. Each file represents a mini-algorithm, a logic puzzle, or a foundational programming exercise I've written to master core computer science concepts (such as control structures, loops, and memory management).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C
* **Environment:** Code::Blocks / GCC Compiler

## 📌 Note to Visitors
This repository is a continuous work in progress. I upload my practice files here as I learn and apply new concepts. I do not maintain a strict index; instead, each file is descriptively named based on its function (e.g., finding sums, reversing numbers). Feel free to explore the code!
